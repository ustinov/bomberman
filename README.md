bomberman
=========

Websocket client app and utilitary modules for Codenjoy Bomberman Game

Designed to be run with python3

Depends on websocket-client from
https://github.com/liris/websocket-client/blob/py3/websocket.py


The bomberman actions logic should be extended by modifying
the find_direction method in dds.py (DumbDirectionSolver) or
by calling your own method from get() in the same dds.py
